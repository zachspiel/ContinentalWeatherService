        <p class="text-left">I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your accurate weather predictions the past six winters. It is so important for us to have an accurate idea of when a storm will hit a certain area and how much snow will fall so that we can have our trucks and equipment ready in time. Your services have been extremely important to us during the past six winters. I have been in business 15 years and I have never slept so good knowing that if I had anything to worry about my phone would ring. I will never forget the incident in which most of our local forecasters were calling for a major snowstorm. You told me not to worry about it and that I should expect about an inch and a half of snow. Your were exactly right! I believe that because of your ability to keep me informed, our response times to our accounts got excellent reviews on the surveys we sent out to our customers. My worst nightmare would be to wake up in the morning to snow on the ground. The last six years, with your service, this has never happened because of your friendly 3am phone calls. You can use me as a reference anytime. Thanks again!

        <p class="text-left">It is my pleasure to highly recommend the profesional services of Continental Weather Service. Mike Spiel has done an outstanding job of forecasting winter weather for the city of Elmhurst ever since the beginning of Continental. His twice daily faxed reports have been quite accurate thus allowing us to anticipate snowstorms in advance and be better prepared for them. His availibility at any time of the day or night for questions and consultations has been a great asset in making critical decisions regarding snow fighting operations. His pleasant demeanor helps make the often frustrating task of mobilizing men and equipment a lot easier. We have been very pleased with all aspects of our dealings with Continental Weather Service and plan to continue using Mike as our key forecaster for future years.
        <br>
